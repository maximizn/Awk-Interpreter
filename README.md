**AWK Interpreter**
java project


**Description:**

The Awk Interpreter is a Java-based tool that translates and interprets code written in the Awk programming language. 
Awk is traditionally used for pattern scanning and processing, particularly in data extraction and reporting tasks. 
This interpreter replicates Awk's core functionalities, enabling Java to execute commands and expressions written in Awk.

**Key Features:**

**Operations Handling:** Multiple methods are implemented to handle fundamental arithmetic operations, such as addition, multiplication, and division, ensuring accurate translation of Awk expressions.

**Special Character Management:** The interpreter uses several enums to manage and recognize special characters intrinsic to Awk, enhancing its ability to parse and interpret Awk-specific syntax accurately.

**Purpose:**

The project serves as a learning tool to deepen understanding of language interpretation, parsing, and the unique characteristics of the Awk language.
